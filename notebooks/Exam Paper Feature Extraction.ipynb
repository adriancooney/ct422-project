    "### Types of questions\n",
    "#### 1. Simple question\n",
    "A *simple question* is a single or multi line text blurb. It does not have to end with a question mark. It does not require an index. It can follow with marks for the question in the form of `(X)`, `[X]` or any variant.\n",

    "    How did the arsonist get round shaped feet? (20)\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 2. Multiple Choice Question\n",
    "A *multiple choice question* is a *simple question* followed by an indexed list of answers. For types of indexing, see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "    multiple_choice_question = simple_question answer+\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 4. List question\n",
    "A list question is a question that has mutiple sub-questions. A blurb header describes the question or gives instructions on how to answer the sub-questions. Sub-questions are a list of *indexed questions*. A list question can also have an index.\n",

    "Indexing in exam papers is highly inconsistent. Questions can use different forms of numbering within the same exam paper.\n",
