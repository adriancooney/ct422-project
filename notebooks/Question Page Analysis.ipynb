    "# Question Page Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we have our exam page parser. It parses all the indexes of questions and builds up a model of what the exam paper looks like. It works by finding all the indexes in the paper. An index is the numerical, alphabetical or roman characters that we reference questions by (e.g. 1., (b), [c]). We then iterate over these indexes and assume each denotes a question. Each consectutive index of the same type (numerical, alphabetical or roman) describe a list of questions. If the index type changes, we assume that this index denotes a sub-question of the previous index. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say we the indices: `1., (a), (b), i. (c), (d), 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `1.` denotes the first question. Stack: `[]`\n",
    "2. `(a)` is a different class than `1.` (alphabetical vs numerical) so `(a)` is a sub-question of `1.`. `[Question[1.]]`\n",
    "3. `(b)` is the same class as `(a)` so it is also a sub-question of `1.`. `[Question[1.], Question[(a)]]`\n",
    "4. `i.` is a different class than `(b)` so it's a sub-question of `(b)`. `[Question[1.], Question[(b)]]`\n",
    "5. `(c)` is a different class than `i.` but the same class as `(b)` and the next value (`3`) so it's a sub-question of `1.`. `[Question[1.], Question[(b)], Question[i.]]`\n",
    "6. `(d)` is the same class as `(c)` so it's a sub-question of `1.`. `[Question[1.], Question[(c)]]`\n",
    "7. `2.` is a different class than `(d)` so it's a top-level question, alongside `1.`. `[Question[1.]]`\n",
    "8. `[Question[1.], Question[2.]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The final structure would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.\n",
    "    |-- (a)\n",
    "      | (b)\n",
    "      |  |-- i.\n",
    "      | (c)\n",
    "      | (d)\n",
    "    2.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Considerations\n",
    "* Sometimes questions have marks in the form of an index e.g. `(10)`\n",
    " \n",
    "  To combat this, we look at the previous index `i` of the same type (i.e. numerical) and see if it's value is `i - 1`. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  In future, we could refine it to look to see if two indexes are sitting right i.e. marks at the end of a question and the next question's index. If this case happens we could drop the marks. We have to be careful of dropping a multiple choice answer that could have been an image (i.e. no text, just an index) from being parsed as marks in that situation (See chemistry paper extraction).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* Sometimes sentences end with a single letter or digit e.g. `potassium K.`\n",
    "\n",
    "  To account for this, we will parse the letter or digit as an index and then look at it's position relative to the previous index. If for instance, the index was alphabetical with the value \"K\" which translates to position 11 in a list, if the last index is not the alphabetical index with position 10, we can safely discard the \"K\". Unfortunately, this does come with caveat that indices *could* line up.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Caveats\n",
    "Currently this algorithm has some caveats:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We cannot determine between multiple choice answers and sub-questions.\n",
    "* We cannot determine between a sentence ending in `<SPC>[0-9].` and an index.\n",
    "* We cannot determine inline references to indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "These caveats are all caused by sampling on the body of text. They could be alleviated if we moved to a more detailed library such as PDFMiner and extracted geometries associated with different bodies of text. It would solve most if not all the problems of ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's build the parser."
