Outline the model explaining both the representation of queries and documents and a means to calculate similarity. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of such an approach.                (9)  (b) The accuracy of the vector space model depends on the quality of the weighting of the terms in both the query and documents. Discuss, with reference to Zipf’s law, any suitably good weighting scheme.          (8)   (c) Describe suitable data structures you would use to implement an information retrieval system adopting the vector space model. Discuss the efficiency of your proposed approach.             (8)    Q.2    (a) What is meant by Relevance Feedback in Information Retrieval Systems and what are the potential benefits of adopting relevance feedback approaches. Describe the Rocchio approach to relevance feedback in the Vector Space Model.      (6)   (b) Discuss, with the aid of examples, how an analysis of the document collection  and the returned set, may be used to modify a user’s query.       (4)   (c) The extended Boolean model has been often been used to overcome some of the limitations of the classical Boolean model. Discuss the extended Boolean model. Your answer should explain, with examples, how queries are represented and how comparison to documents is achieved.        (8)  (d) The assumption of term independence is made in the classical Vector space model. What is meant by the term independence assumption. Outline a retrieval model which attempts to overcome the term independence assumption.    (7)          Q.3  (a) Define what is meant by collaborative filtering. Describe, with a suitable example, the main stages involved in generating a recommendation for a user via collaborative filtering.           (9)  (b) Outline some of the difficulties or limitations associated with collaborative filtering.             (4)   (c) Explain the structure of a decision tree. Explain how a decision tree could be developed from a set of tuples of the form <attribute1, attribute2, … attributen, category> such that future tuples of the form  <attribute1, attribute2, … attributen> can be accurately placed in a correct category.       (8)  (d) Suggest how traditional collaborative filtering or classification (using decision trees or alternative approach) could be applied in the domain of web search.  (4)     Q.4  (a) Many modern web-based search engines attempt to take into account the web link structure in addition to the content of the pages. Describe the Page Rank algorithm that uses information embedded in the web link structure to return relevant documents to a user. Discuss any limitations associated with this approach.         (11)   (b) Explain briefly how this algorithm could be extended to take into account user-provided preferences.

Provide examples of how ambiguity might arise in natural language and suggest an approach to resolving such ambiguities.
