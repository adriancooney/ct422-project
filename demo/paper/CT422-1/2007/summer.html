            <p>Learning approaches have been adopted in information retrieval systems to either adapt to changes in user behaviours or to learn an optimal manner in which to combine information or process information to give good performance. Neural networks and evolutionary computation are two such learning approaches. Discuss either learning approach in relation to a problem of your choice in information retrieval. Your answer should also identify the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.       (13) </p>

            <p>In recent years, there has been a move towards distributed information retrieval systems.
