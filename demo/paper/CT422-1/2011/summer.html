            <p>Traditional information retrieval systems typically rank documents based on the similarity of the content in the documents to the content in the user queries. In addition to ranking based on content matching, it is decided to build a system that also ranks based on the style of the documents. A system is required to rank documents depending on how well-written they are. Describe how one could achieve this requirement. Your answer should describe: </p>

            <p>Social search relates to using social relationships between people to recommend information or people to users. Given twitter data (content of tweets, sender, re-tweets, follower data), various graphs can be created to represent the social relationships between users.  This graph can then be used to extract features regarding groups of users which may be useful in making recommendations.</p>
